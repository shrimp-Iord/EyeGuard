"""Local capture of what app/site was active at flag time.

Stamps each flag with the frontmost app, the active browser URL (where the
browser exposes it to automation), and the front window title. This corroborates
*what* was on screen with *where* it came from — entirely on-device, with no
dependency on any external service (e.g. Accountable2You).

Permissions: window-title capture uses System Events and needs Accessibility
permission for the host process; URL capture uses per-browser automation
(Automation permission). Both fail gracefully — if not granted, the field is
simply omitted rather than blocking a flag.
